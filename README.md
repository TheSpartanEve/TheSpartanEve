- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheSpartanEve and I come from Sweden. 
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, sewing and gardening. I mostly play on xbox, but also a bit pc. I love halo, minecraft, the sims, the witcher, No man's sky and a bunch of other games. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and HTML, I'm a total beginner and started a little over a month ago. 
- 💞️ I’m currently just trying to figure programming out and see if this is something for me, so far I like it! 
- 📫 If you play on xbox, just hit me up! My gt is @The Spartan Eve
